<title>Native Client Examples</title>

<body>
<h1>Native Client Examples</h1>
<dd><p>This page lists all of the examples available in the most recent Native
 Client SDK bundle. Each example is designed to teach a few specific Native
 Client programming concepts.  You will need to setup the build environment
 including a path to 'make' which can be found in the 'tools' directory for
 Windows, and the variable NACL_SDK_ROOT which points to one of the pepper
 bundles found under the SDK install location.  Calling make from the examples
 directory will build all the projects, while calling make from an individual
 example directory will build only that example.
</p></dd>

<h3>Using the Tools</h3>
<dd><p>The following "hello_world" examples, show the basic outline of a
several types of Native Client applications.   The simplest, "Hello World Stdio"
uses several provided libraries to simplify startup and provides a
simplified make showing a single build configuration.  The other examples in
this SDK however, are designed to build and run with multiple toolsets, build
configurations, etc...
making the build much more complex.  In all cases we are using <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html">GNU Make</a>.
See the link for further information.
</p></dd>

  <dt><a href="hello_world_stdio/index.html">Hello World STDIO.</a></dt>
  <dd>

  The Hello World Stdio example is the simplest one in the SDK.  It uses the
ppapi_main library which creates an Module and Instance, using default values
to simplify setup and communication with the PPAPI system.  In addition, it
uses the nacl_io library to remap IO to the Pepper API.  This
simplifies IO by providing a standard blocking API and allowing STDERR to go to
the JavaScript console by default.
  <p>Teaching focus: Basic HTML, JavaScript, Minimal App.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt><a href="hello_world/index.html">Hello World.</a></dt>
  <dd>
The Hello World In C example demonstrates the basic structure of all
Native Client applications. This example loads a Native Client module.  The
page tracks the status of the module as it load.  On a successful load, the
module will post a message containing the string "Hello World" back to
JavaScript which will display it as an alert.
  <p>Teaching focus: Basic HTML, JavaScript, and module architecture.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt><a href="hello_world_interactive/index.html">Interactive Hello World in C++</a></dt>
  <dd>
The Interactive Hello World C++ example demonstrates the basic structure
of all Native Client applications. This example loads a Native Client module
which uses two way interaction with JavaScript whenever a button is clicked.
The NaCl module will respond with the number 42 or the reversed version of the
string in the text box when the appropriate button is clicked.
  <p>Teaching focus: Basic HTML, JavaScript, C++ PPAPI, and Messaging API.</p>
  </dd>

<h3>Common APIs</h3>
<dd><p>The following set of examples illustrate various Pepper APIs including
audio, 2D, 3D, file I/O, input and urls.</p></dd>
 
  <dt><a href="file_histogram/index.html">File Histogram.</a></dt>
  <dd>
The File Histogram example demonstrates prompting the user for a file,
passing the file contents to NativeClient as a VarArrayBuffer, then drawing a
histogram representing the contents of the file to a 2D square.

  <p>Teaching focus: VarArrayBuffer, 2D, File input.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt><a href="file_io/index.html">File I/O</a></dt>
  <dd>
The File IO example demonstrates saving, loading, and deleting files
from the persistent file store.
  <p>Teaching focus: File input and output.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt><a href="gamepad/index.html">Gamepad Example.</a></dt>
  <dd>
Attached gamepad values should appear, left to right, once they've been
interacted with. Buttons, esp triggers are analog.

  <p>Teaching focus: Gamepad interface.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt><a href="geturl/index.html">Get URL</a></dt>
  <dd>
The Get URL example demonstrates fetching an URL and then displaying
its contents.  Clicking the GetURL button will cause a geturl_success.html
file to get loaded asynchronously, then displayed in a text box when the
load completes.
  <p>Teaching focus: URL loading.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt><a href="hello_world_gles/index.html">Hello World GLES 2.0</a></dt>
  <dd>
The Hello World GLES 2.0 example demonstrates how to create a 3D cube
that rotates.  This is a simpler example than the tumbler example, and
written in C.  It loads the assets using URLLoader.
  <p>Teaching focus: 3D graphics, URL Loader.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt><a href="hello_world_instance3d/index.html">Hello World GLES 2.0 using ppapi_instance3d</a></dt>
  <dd>
The Hello World GLES 2.0 example demonstrates how to create a 3D cube
that rotates.  This is a simpler example than the tumbler example, and
written in C.  It loads the assets using URLLoader.
  <p>Teaching focus: 3D graphics, URL Loader.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt><a href="input_events/index.html">Input Events</a></dt>
  <dd>The Input Events example shows how to handle input events in a
multi-threaded application.  The main thread converts input events to
non-pepper events and puts them on a queue. The worker thread pulls them off of
the queue, converts them to a string, and then uses CallOnMainThread so that
PostMessage can be send the result of the worker thread to the browser.
  <p>Teaching focus: Multi-threading, keyboard and mouse input, view change, and focus
events.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt><a href="sine_synth/index.html">Sine Wave Synthesizer</a></dt>
  <dd>
The Sine Wave Synthesizer example demonstrates playing sound (a sine
wave).  Enter the desired frequency and hit play to start, stop to end. The
frequency box will display "Loading, please wait." while the module loads.
  <p>Teaching focus: Audio.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt><a href="websocket/index.html">Websocket</a></dt>
  <dd>
The Websocket example demonstrates how to use the Websocket API.  The
user first connects to the test server: ws://html5rocks.websocket.org/echo by
clicking on the 'Connect'' button.  Then hitting Send' will cause the app to
send the message to the server and retrieve the reply.
  <p>Teaching focus: Websockets</p>
  </dd>

<h3>Common Concepts</h3>
<dd><p>The following set of examples illustrate various common concepts such as
showing load progress, using Shared Objects (dynamic libraries),
mulithreading...</p></dd>

  <dt><a href="debugging/index.html">Debugging</a></dt>
  <dd>
Debugging example shows how to use developer only features to enable
catching an exception, and then using that to create a stacktrace.
  <p>Teaching focus: Debugging, Stacktraces.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt><a href="dlopen/index.html">Dynamic Library Open</a></dt>
  <dd>
The dlopen example demonstrates how build dynamic libraries and then
open and use them at runtime.  When the page loads, type in a question and
hit enter or click the ASK! button.  The question and answer will be
displayed in the page under the text entry box.  Shared libraries are only
available with the GLIBC toolchain.
  <p>Teaching focus: Using shared objects.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt><a href="hello_nacl_io/index.html">Hello, Nacl IO!</a></dt>
  <dd>
The NaCl IO example demonstrates mapping standard FILE such as fopen,
fread, fwrite into mounts by linking in the nacl_io library.  This allows
developers to wrap Pepper API such as the File IO API or URL Loader into
standard blocking calls.
  <p>Teaching focus: Using NaCl IO.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt><a href="load_progress/index.html">Load Progress</a></dt>
  <dd>
The Load Progress example demonstrates how to listen for and handle
events that occur while a NaCl module loads.  This example listens for
different load event types and dispatches different events to their
respective handler. This example also checks for valid browser version and
shows how to calculate and display loading progress.
  <p>Teaching focus: Progress event handling.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt><a href="mouselock/index.html">Mouse Lock</a></dt>
  <dd>
The Mouselock example demonstrates how to use the MouseLock API to hide
the mouse cursor.  Mouse lock is only available in full-screen mode.  You can
lock and unlock the mouse while in full-screen mode by pressing the Enter key.

  <p>Teaching focus: Mouse lock, Full-screen.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt><a href="pi_generator/index.html">Monte Carlo Estimate for Pi</a></dt>
  <dd>
The Pi Generator example demonstrates creating a helper thread that
estimate pi using the Monte Carlo method while randomly putting 1,000,000,000
points inside a 2D square that shares two sides with a quarter circle.
  <p>Teaching focus: Thread creation, 2D graphics, view change events.</p>
